<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project developed for Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2022-2023). In this project, we addressed the issue of binary classification, considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images.In this scenario, our proposed approach is to employ Convolutional Neural Network frameworks, which are more suitable in case of image classification.


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Tensorflow version: 2.9.2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/)
