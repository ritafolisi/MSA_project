<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project developed for Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2022-2023). In this project, we address the issue of binary classification, considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images. In this scenario, our proposed approach is to employ Convolutional Neural Network frameworks, which are more suitable in case of image classification. 


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Tensorflow version: 2.9.2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/)

### Composition of the repository
* [StatisticalMethodsData](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IMxAVaz4M3xBgfYMJ-d_BYU-SJ2i2gIN): folder in which all .json files about the experiments are collected.
* [Visualization](https://github.com/ritafolisi/MSA_project/tree/main/Visualizations): folder in which some visualizations generated on colab are visible. 

### Initialization
We saved all the .tf files on a Google Drive folder, so that we could run our code without retraining the models each time. Since Colab is connected to Google Drive, we suggest to use this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eyi_jGvlOI5vzNZWXnwCvJ3NqwChRhzi) to speed up the process.
